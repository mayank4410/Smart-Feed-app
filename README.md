SmartFeed 📸✨
Welcome to SmartFeed, a modern, lightweight, and fully responsive image gallery web application designed to offer an enjoyable browsing experience! Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS Grid, SmartFeed dynamically loads beautiful images categorized by themes such as Nature 🌿, Mountains 🏔️, Business 💼, Girls 👧, Boys 👦, and Children 🧒.

Features ⭐
Category Filters 🎯: Quickly switch between different categories using the clean, horizontally scrollable category bar. The active category is highlighted for easy navigation.

Infinite Scrolling 🔄: Say goodbye to pagination! Images load automatically as you scroll near the bottom of the page, making browsing seamless and uninterrupted.

Responsive Design 📱💻: The app adjusts beautifully to all screen sizes—from smartphones and tablets to large desktop monitors.

Smooth Hover Effects ✨: Images gently zoom in on hover, enhancing interactivity and user engagement.

Sticky Header 📌: The category bar stays fixed at the top of the screen during scrolling, so you can switch categories anytime without hassle.

How It Works 🔍
SmartFeed loads random images from Picsum Photos to simulate dynamic content for each category. When you select a category, the gallery refreshes and displays new images related to your choice. Infinite scroll listens for when you near the page bottom and loads additional images automatically to keep the feed going.
