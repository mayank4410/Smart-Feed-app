SmartFeed 📸✨
SmartFeed is a modern, responsive image gallery web app built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS Grid. It provides a smooth, user-friendly experience to browse categorized images with infinite scrolling and dynamic loading. Perfect for learning, portfolios, or a foundation to build advanced image gallery projects.

Advanced Features 🚀
Category Filtering: Easily switch between multiple image categories (Nature, Mountains, Business, Girls, Boys, Children) via a sticky, scrollable category bar.

Infinite Scroll: Automatically loads more images as the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, enabling uninterrupted browsing.

Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes — mobile, tablet, desktop — with CSS Grid for optimal layout.

Smooth Hover Effects: Images slightly zoom on hover with subtle shadow effects, enhancing interactivity.

Sticky Header: Keeps the category bar fixed at the top for quick access at any scroll position.

Dynamic Image Loading: Fetches random images from the Picsum Photos API, simulating live dynamic content per category.

Lightweight & Fast: Built without frameworks, keeping the app performant and easy to customize.

Usage 🛠️
Open index.html in a modern browser.

Select a category from the top bar to load images relevant to that category.

Scroll down to trigger infinite scrolling — more images load automatically.

Hover over images to enjoy smooth zoom animations.

Switch categories anytime; the gallery refreshes accordingly.

Architecture & Code Structure 🏗️
HTML: Semantic markup defines the layout — header with categories and a gallery grid container.

CSS: Uses CSS Grid for responsive gallery layout and Flexbox for category bar. Includes smooth transitions and hover animations.

JavaScript: Handles dynamic image loading, infinite scroll, category switching, and DOM manipulation:

Gallery Loader: Adds images dynamically using the Picsum Photos API with randomized URLs.

Category Switcher: Changes active category, clears existing images, and loads new ones.

Infinite Scroll Listener: Detects scroll near page bottom to load more images.

API Source: Images fetched from Picsum Photos (random images for demo purposes).

FAQs ❓
Q1: Are the images really categorized?
A: Currently, Picsum Photos doesn’t support real category filtering; categories are simulated by randomized image loads. Future versions plan to integrate real APIs like Unsplash or Pixabay.

Q2: Can I use this project for commercial purposes?
A: Yes, the project is open-source. However, check image source licenses if you integrate real APIs.

Q3: How to customize categories?
A: Edit the category list in the HTML and update JavaScript if integrating a real API.

Q4: Does this app work offline?
A: No, it requires internet to fetch images from the Picsum Photos API.

Q5: Can I add a modal to view images larger?
A: Not yet, but it’s a great idea for future improvement!
